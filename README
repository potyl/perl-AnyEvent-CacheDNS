This is module is very basic and has no policies for clearing our invalidating
the DNS cache. Patches and suggestions are welcome.

PROJECT

The project is now hosted on github (http://github.com/potyl/perl-AnyEvent-CacheDNS/)
which provides the latest source code and a simple bug tracking.

Even tough github provides a download facility, the project's source code
bundles will always be published through CPAN. It's easier this way for the
project and after all this is a Perl project!

BUGS

Please when possible try to submit the bugs through the github issue tracker
(http://github.com/potyl/perl-AnyEvent-CacheDNS/issues) otherwise simply create a
ticket through RT.
